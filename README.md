Welcome to **momo-research**. This is a public research log for **Context Engineering** and **Persistent Memory** for AI agents.

This repository serves as a archive of insights from papers focused on:

- **Context engineering**
- **Long-term and persistent memory for agents**
- **Memory architectures** (summaries, embeddings, symbolic, sequential)
- **Unified organizational memory**
- **Agent workflows and memory-aware system design**

Our goal is to translate complex technical research into **actionable insights** that help developers, builders, and researchers understand how AI agents can leverage memory more effectively.

## Why This Repo Exists

We believe the next generation of AI agents won’t be defined by model size,  
**but by their ability to remember, integrate, and act on information across many apps over time.**

This repository documents our process as we:

- Study foundational research
- Extract the core principles of context engineering
- Apply these insights to build real memory-as-a-tool modules for modern applications

Our goal is to push forward the understanding and implementation of persistent memory systems and openly share what we learn along the way.

### Implementation Notes

As we develop memory-as-a-tool modules for apps such as Slack, Gmail, and Linear, we will share:

- Architecture sketches
- Design rationales
- Lessons learned
- Example implementations

We are also building a lightweight **Memory Playground** where developers can test these modules, inspect how memory is stored and retrieved, and experiment with different context-engineering strategies in a real environment.

These modules are part of our broader effort to build unified, persistent memory systems for agents.
